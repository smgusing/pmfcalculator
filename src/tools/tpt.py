def find_top_paths(sources, sinks, tprob, num_paths=10, node_wipe=False, net_flux=None):
    """
    Calls the Dijkstra algorithm to find the top 'NumPaths'.

    Does this recursively by first finding the top flux path, then cutting that
    path and relaxing to find the second top path. Continues until NumPaths
    have been found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : array_like, int
        The indices of the source states
    sinks : array_like, int
        Indices of sink states
    num_paths : int

    Bottlenecks : list of tuples
        The nodes between which exists the path bottleneck
    Fluxes : list of floats
        The flux through each path

    Optional Parameters
    -------------------
    node_wipe : bool
        If true, removes the bottleneck-generating node from the graph, instead
        of just the bottleneck (not recommended, a debugging functionality)
    net_flux : sparse matrix
        Matrix of the net flux from `sources` to `sinks`, see function `net_flux`.
        If not provided, is calculated from scratch. If provided, `tprob` is
